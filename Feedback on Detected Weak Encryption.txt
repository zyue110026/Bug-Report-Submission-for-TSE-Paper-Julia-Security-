Greetings, 


We are some security researchers who have built a scanner to detect known security weaknesses. For your repository, we have found instances of Weak Encryption in the following locations: 

Location-1: https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl/blob/100c30ec942e5e38d4a987dbef6b30c85dda9fbf/test/AWS.jl#L95


Please give us feedback. Do you think these are valid instances on security weaknesses? Will you fix them?
