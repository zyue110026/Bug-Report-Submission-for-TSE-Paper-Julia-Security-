Greetings, 


We are some security researchers who have built a scanner to detect known security weaknesses. For your repository, we have found instances of Weak Encryption in the following locations: 

Location-1: line 95


Please give us feedback. Do you think these are valid instances on security weaknesses? Will you fix them?
