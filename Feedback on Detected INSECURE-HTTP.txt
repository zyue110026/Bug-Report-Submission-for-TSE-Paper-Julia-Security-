Greetings, 


We are some security researchers who have built a scanner to detect known security weaknesses. For your repository, we have found instances of INSECURE-HTTP in the following locations: 

Location-1: line 4
Location-2: line 6
Location-3: line 7
Location-4: line 208
Location-5: line 209
Location-6: line 210
Location-7: line 211

Please give us feedback. Do you think these are valid instances on security weaknesses? Will you fix them?
