Greetings, 


We are some security researchers who have built a scanner to detect known security weaknesses. For your repository, we have found instances of CODE_INJECTION in the following locations: 

Location-1: line 60
Location-2: line 359
Location-3: line 490
Location-4: line 532
Location-5: line 586
Location-6: line 666
Location-7: line 714
Location-8: line 1404
Location-9: line 1416
Location-10: line 1418

Please give us feedback. Do you think these are valid instances on security weaknesses? Will you fix them?
