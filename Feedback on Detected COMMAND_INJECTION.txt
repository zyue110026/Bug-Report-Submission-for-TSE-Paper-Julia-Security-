Greetings, 


We are some security researchers who have built a scanner to detect known security weaknesses. For your repository, we have found instances of COMMAND_INJECTION in the following locations: 

Location-1: line 14
Location-2: line 19
Location-3: line 22
Location-4: line 23
Location-5: line 38
Location-6: line 41
Location-7: line 55
Location-8: line 56

Please give us feedback. Do you think these are valid instances on security weaknesses? Will you fix them?
